ðŸš¦ Traffic Congestion Analysis Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning
This project presents a data-driven approach to urban traffic congestion analysis by leveraging surveillance video feeds. Using computer vision techniques, the system extracts vehicle count and speed metrics to assess congestion levels across different times and days.

The extracted features are used to:

Perform temporal trend analysis of traffic congestion.

Build and evaluate machine learning models to classify congestion levels.

Identify traffic bottlenecks and congestion hotspots for smarter urban traffic management.
